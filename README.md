## Implementing a solitaire simulator and extracting the winning probabilities out of it, with few lines ofÂ codes

Hello and thanks for being here! 

With this few lines of code you can implement the famous Italian solitaire (Uno, Due e Tre) and extract a statistics out of it. This tiny project is meant to show the power of simulation and its ability to forecast the probability of winning (or loosing) a match, giving the player the idea of the complex combination of events that need to happen in order to win the game. 

The code is entirely implemented in Python. 

Please let me know if you have any comments, or doubts, or something you would like to add or fix. 

Thank you!

Ciao. :)
